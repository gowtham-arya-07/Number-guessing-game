# Number-guessing-game
Game is about to guess the number randomly
Game Start:

1.The game informs the user: "You have 7 characters" (this likely means 7 chances or attempts â€” "characters" seems to be a typo and should be "chances").

*The user is prompted to enter:

*A lower bound (low) and

*A higher bound (high)

*The game then randomly selects a secret number (num) between low and high.

2.Gameplay Loop:

*The player gets up to 7 attempts to guess the number.

*On each guess:

*If the guess is correct, the program prints the correct number and ends the game.

*If the guess is too low, the program advises: "try high number".

*If the guess is too high, the program advises: "try lower number".

*If all 7 attempts are used up without a correct guess, it prints: "better luck next time".
